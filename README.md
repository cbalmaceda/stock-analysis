# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
Steve’s parents asked him to check on how the DQ stock did in 2017 and 2018. For this challenge we are refactoring the module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information we did in the module. 

### Purpose
We want to see if refactoring the code made it faster and therefore more efficient than it was in the module. 

## Results
By refactoring the code, we have helped Steve be more efficient with his 2017 and 2018 data research. The below photos of the code run in seconds show us the refactored code was faster than it did in the module.

## Summary

Overall, the refactored code had an advantage of being faster than the code used in the module. The disadvantage for me was receiving a lot of syntax errors and figuring out how to write the code. It also took a lot longer due to having to test the code several times and having to debugg. 

I had several difficulties with this week’s challenge. I felt there was little guidance and a lot of sections in the module were not clear, unlike last week. It was frustrating for me since I’m new to coding.
