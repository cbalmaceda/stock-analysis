# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
Steveâ€™s parents asked him to check on how the DQ stock did in 2017 and 2018. For this challenge we are refactoring the module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information we did in the module. 

### Purpose
We want to see if refactoring the code made it faster and therefore more efficient than it was in the module.
